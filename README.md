## Introduction

[![PRs Welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/PRs-welcome-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square)](http://makeapullrequest.com)

[Trustee](https://jaddevvv.github.io/Hackathon-From-LLM-To-Agentic-AI/) is a Chrome Extension that leverages advanced AI to protect users from scams on online marketplaces. It acts as a real-time trust advisor, analyzing listings and conversations to help users make informed decisions. The AI, powered by Mistral AI, simulates realistic decision-making and provides detailed trust scores for sellers and listings.

This project was developed during the ESSEC Hackathon 2025, focusing on the transition from LLMs to agentic AI. I worked on this project with [Jad Kabbaj](https://github.com/Jaddevvv) and [Jordan Baumard](https://github.com/jordanbmrd) who made the frontend, and with Anais Boughanem for the backend. Imane Ourdane handled the business part.

The extension :
1. Analyzes marketplace listings using computer vision and NLP
2. Monitors chat conversations in real-time
3. Generates trust scores based on multiple factors
4. Provides actionable insights to users

## Context
